# SpinningWaveformPublicData
This repository present the gravitational waveform data at tree level for arbitrary spin without expansion the spin parameter.

## Waveform data with non-perturbative spin
The file for waveform data with exact result is in "resAllFinalq1New.txt" and "resAllFinalq2New.txt". 

"resAllFinalq1New.txt" is for the $q_1^2$ channel.
"resAllFinalq2New.txt" is for the $q_2^2$ channel. 
To get the full waveform contribution, you need to add them together.


## Waveform data with Taylor expansion on the spin parameter $a$
The file for waveform data with exact result is in "resAllFinalq2NewSeries.txt" and "resAllFinalq2NewSeries.txt". Here we only put out the expanded result upto $a^4$ order. If you need the result for higher spin orders, please contact the authors. 

"resAllFinalq1NewSeries.txt" is for the $q_1^2$ channel.
"resAllFinalq2NewSeries.txt" is for the $q_2^2$ channel. 
Similarly, to get the full waveform contribution, you need to add them together.
