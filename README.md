# SpinningWaveformPublicData
This repository present the gravitational waveform data at tree level for arbitrary spin without expansion the spin parameter.

## Waveform data with non-perturbative spin
The file for waveform data with exact result is in "resAllFinalq1New.txt" and "resAllFinalq2New.txt". 
"resAllFinalq1New.txt" is for the $q_1^2$ channel
